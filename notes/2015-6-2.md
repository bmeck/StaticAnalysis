# Points

* Existing tools/competing should be placed in prior-work
* Spec needs both test suite and typing spec
  * WebIDL seems likely
* CFG+IR is the most likely output we will be taking
  * Allowing steps to branch individually instead of on block
* Tool uses discussed, nothing new.
* Need to start creating a list of intrinsics
* Need to finally IR type/structure
